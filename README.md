# CoX Spam Scout

Bored of finding that perfect CoX scout? Constantly autopiloting past good raids? This plugin is for you!

With this plugin enabled, you will be able to spam click the steps in the CoX lobby until a desired raid is found.

You can determine which raids are found via the config settings. There are three groups available for you to easily toggle between raid styles (e.g. group 1 could be solos, group 2 could be 3+12s and group 3 could be megascales)

Each group is split on new line, and is in the following format:

`SCFCPCSCFS: Guardians, Mystics, Shamans, Tightrope, *`

That will find raids that exactly match the SCFCPCSCFS layout with the exact order of Guardians, Mystics, Shamans, Tightrope, followed by a wildcard for any other room.

If you want to find variations of this, simply add more lines with the variations.

The plugin supports regexes, so if you want to add more complex search criteria, feel free to do so!
